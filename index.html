    <h2>Static and Relative Positioning</h2>
    <p>The default positioning mode that you’ve gotten used to is position: static. 
        The difference between static and relative is fairly simple. Static is the 
        default position of every element, and properties top, right, bottom, and 
        left do not affect the position of the element. Relative on the other hand 
        is pretty much the same as static, but properties top, right...(etc.) 
        displace the element relative to its normal position in the flow of the document.</p>
    <h2>Absolute Positioning</h2>
    <p>position: absolute allows you to position something at an exact point on the screen 
        without disturbing the other elements around it. More specifically, using absolute 
        positioning on an element will remove that element from the normal document flow 
        while being positioned relative to an ancestor element. To put it in other words: 
        elements that are removed from the normal flow of the document don’t affect other 
        elements and are also not affected by other elements. Using absolute positioning 
        allows you to position elements anywhere on the screen using top, right, bottom, 
        and left properties. This property is really useful when you want to position 
        something at an exact point on the screen, without disturbing any of the other 
        elements. A couple of good use cases for absolute positioning are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>modals</li>
            <li>image with a caption on it</li>
            <li>icons on top of other elements</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Fixed Positioning</h2>
        <p>Fixed elements are also removed from the normal flow of the document and are 
            positioned relative to the viewport. You basically use top, right, bottom, 
            and left properties to position it, and it will stay there as the user scrolls. 
            This is especially useful for things like navigation bars and floating chat buttons.</p>
